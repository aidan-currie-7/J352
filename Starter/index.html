<h1>Welcome to My Mick Cronin Page!</h1>


<p>Welcome to the online forum for all things "Mr. 5-foot-3 with an attitude."</p>

<p>Here you will find a biography, images, and postgame press conference clips of the best bald head coach in men's college basketball.</p> 

<p>If you don't believe me, check the <a href="https://uclabruins.com/sports/mens-basketball/schedule" target="_blank">schedule</a>. UCLA was in struggle town just three weeks ago, and now Cronin has his boys on a heater!</p>

<p>Coach Cronin delivered an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwaLey5pkVc" target="_blank">angry address to the media</a> following UCLA's 94-75 loss against Michigan in early January. But recently, he's been in <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w2RSnrwSbY" target="_blank">much brighter spirits</a>.</p>

<p> Check out some video highlights <a href="video.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
