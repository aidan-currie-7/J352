<h1>The History of LB Poly</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Founded in 1895, Long Beach Polytechnic High School has one of the most storied pasts of any educational institution in Southern California. Geographically speaking, the public school sits in the middle of Long Beach, although the Jackrabbits often refer to their location as the “Eastside.”</p>

<p>LB Poly currently enrolls just shy of 4,000 students, making it one of the largest public high schools (by student population) in the entire country.</p> 

<p>The school itself (displayed in the juxtaposition map below) may seem small for its population, and that’s because it is. With urban development along all sides, LB Poly hasn’t seen much physical expansion into the surrounding area during its nearly 130-year history.</p> 

<p>But some argue (myself included) that the bordering urban neighborhood gives the school its classic Long Beach charm.</p> 

<h3>Over the years</h3> 

<p>The slider below breaks down some of the changes to the high school and its surrounding area over the past 20+ years. As you can see … not much has changed. The most notable difference is the inclusion of the all-weather track, and turf field on the far right-hand side of the school.</p>
