<h1>A Decade of Californian Complaints</h1>

<h6>By: Aidan Currie | April 24, 2025</h6>

<p><a href="https://navient.com" target="_blank">Navient Corporation</a>, one of the country's largest federal student loan services, has been under fire for the better part of the past decade. A <a href="https://www.studentloanplanner.com/navient-lawsuit-updates/" target="_blank">recent story from Student Loan Planner</a> detailed Navient’s extensive line of financial mishandlings, which culminated in a 2022 settlement that required the organization to provide $1.85 billion in aid, distributed among both private and federal student loan borrowers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov" targrt="_blank">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> was one of the many groups to file a lawsuit against Navient in recent years as well. The CFPB has also been <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/?chartType=line&dateInterval=Month&dateRange=3y&date_received_max=2025-04-22&date_received_min=2022-04-22&lens=Product&searchField=all&subLens=sub_product&tab=Trends" target="_blank">tracking nationwide complaints</a> lodged against Navient since 2011.</p>

<p>The CFPB broke these complaints down by states, with California, unsurprisingly, being one of the states with the highest total complaints. Here’s the year-by-year breakdown of California complaints against Navient:</p>

<iframe title="Complaints Per Year in California" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-TV5wf" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TV5wf/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="416" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();
</script>

<br>

<p>The per-year complaint rate from Californians grew steadily for much of the past decade, but has increased exponentially over the past couple of years. 2024 saw about 269,000 complaints, making it the first year that total complaints jumped by more than double from the previous year (the figure was just below 133,000 in 2023). California’s total complaints sit at just below 138,000 so far this year (through April 23rd), meaning the trend of increasing every year is likely to continue.</p>
