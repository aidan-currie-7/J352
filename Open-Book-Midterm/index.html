<h6>Take a group trip to North Carolina’s Crystal Coast.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>According to Jen Curran, owner of Archipelagos Travel Design, group trips and slow travel continue to be popular choices among travelers this year. To pair the two trends together, pencil in a week for a vacation on North Carolina’s Crystal Coast, an 85-mile stretch of coastline with 56 miles of protected beaches. “Our travelers want to really sink in to get a real sense of place,” she explains. And you can do just that by renting a beachfront house in Emerald Isle or Atlantic Beach and paddleboarding, biking, and relaxing by the sea.</p>

<h6>Check out Charleston’s newest restaurants and cocktail bars.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>One of the South’s best cities, Charleston has long had a thriving, dynamic culinary scene. While fan favorites like Little Jack’s Tavern, The Ordinary, and Fig continue to deserve recognition, the coastal city’s ever-growing roster of restaurants and bars has a handful of new additions you may not have tried yet. Italian restaurant Legami opened in October 2024, and Seahorse, a cocktail bar from the Chubby Fish team, served its first drinks this past December. By the Way, sibling to Uptown Social and Bodega, is another welcome addition, as is James Beard Best Chef finalist Nikko Cagalanan’s Kultura, an elevated Filipino joint now in its second year of operations.</p>

<h6>Choose a lakefront vacation on Mackinac Island.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>Those who prefer the cool, still waters of a lake to the ocean should look no further than Mackinac Island, a car-free destination between Michigan’s Upper and Lower peninsulas. Tourism season begins in May and peaks from early July to mid-August. Visitors venture to the island for all sorts of nostalgic summertime activities, including flying kites, riding bikes, and sailing and swimming in Lake Huron.</p>

<h6>Discover Houston’s family-friendly side.</h6>

<aside class="pull-quote">
	<blockquote>
<p>“This year, I am still seeing a lot of multi-gen trips.” — Aimee Suthann, owner of Truly Connected Travel</p>
    </blockquote>
</aside>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>Houston, Texas, is full of activities that will entertain travelers of all ages (and keep them out of the sun). There’s the Downtown Aquarium, the Houston Museum of Natural Science, and the Space Center Houston. Or, you could book a two-bedroom suite at Thompson Houston, where you can get a break from the Texas heat at the rooftop infinity pool.</p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Live out your cowboy dreams at a dude ranch.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>Daryn Schwartz, a luxury and boutique travel advisor with Fora, says she’s seeing travelers gravitate toward vacations where they’ll be able to “unplug from the world and enjoy a bit of nature.” Luxury dude ranches typically fit this bill. She recommends Brush Creek Ranch and The Green O, both of which have all-inclusive packages for guests. In the summer, you can take in the beauty of Wyoming and Montana by horseback riding, fly fishing, hiking, rafting, and ATV rides through the Wild West.</p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Lean into all things wellness in Hawaii.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>Travelers who want to prioritize health and wellness this summer will find the ultimate retreat at Sensei Lanai, a Four Seasons Resort. At the adults-only property, located on the tiny island of Lanai, guests are encouraged to participate in wellness consultations, spa treatments, lectures, and a variety of well-being classes (think guided meditation, aerial yoga, and garden walks).</p>

<h5>International Travel</h5>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Enjoy a quiet getaway in Menorca.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>While Ibiza is known for its nightlife, relaxation is paramount in Menorca, the quieter of Spain’s Balearic Islands. “Menorca is a wonderful destination for travelers seeking a natural rugged coastline, a sustainable food movement, and a wellness focus,” says Suthann, owner of Truly Connected Travel. “This island is a great fit for large groups to rent a renovated farmhouse or a honeymooning couple who wants to retreat to their room, away from the crowds.” If you fall in the latter category, book a suite at Son Vell, a 450-acre estate where you can cool off in two outdoor swimming pools or the blue waters of the property’s own cala (cove).</p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Escape to the <a href="https://uk.usembassy.gov" target="_blank">British</a> seaside in Cornwall.</h6> 

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>England isn’t typically the first country to come to mind when you think of wide, sandy beaches and bright blue water, but summertime in Cornwall is magical. While St. Ives is wildly popular, this part of the country is filled with dozens of other small villages and towns, all within driving distance of the region’s dramatic coastlines and turquoise waters. Fill your days by swimming and sunbathing on Gyllyngvase Beach, Great Western Beach, or Porthcurno Beach, and eating freshly caught seafood for every meal.</p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Visit <a href="https://bb.usembassy.gov/legal-assistance-saint-barthelemy/" target="_blank">St. Barts</a> in its offseason.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>If you’re craving a classic tropical getaway, complete with leisurely beach days and piña coladas, book a weeklong trip to St. Barts. Winter is actually the island’s peak season, which means you won’t have to battle as much traffic in the summer—the roads are small and winding—and coveted dinner reservations will be easier to snag. For an experience that offers the best of both beach lounging and active excursions, book a suite at Le Barthélemy Hotel & Spa. Located in the secluded but still convenient Grand Cul-de-Sac neighborhood, the hotel is the perfect jumping-off point for those wanting to explore the area by Jet Ski or snorkel around the calm, clear waters (keep a lookout for sea turtles).</p>

<h6>Split time between Corsica and Sardinia.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->

<aside class="pull-quote">
	<blockquote>
<p>“Corsica is going to have its moment this year.” - Schwartz</p>
    </blockquote>
</aside>

<p>“With an increase in flights and ferries to the island, we are going to see a big boom in tourism. It’s the perfect off-the-beaten-path destination for a European summer getaway,” continues Schwartz. Ideal for those who want to experience gorgeous blue waters paired with rugged terrain, the French island is also within proximity to Sardinia, a destination that comes recommended by Suthann.</p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>“Sardinia has beautiful untouched sandy beaches, crystal-clear waters, and wonderful small villages all over the island that specialize in ancient traditions and crafts, from basket weavers to cheesemakers,” says Suthann. “The north side of the island is a short boat ride from Corsica, meaning you could have lunch in a French bistro and be back in time for a pizza-making class for dinner.”</p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Go sportfishing in Los Cabos.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>Don’t get us wrong: Los Cabos is hot in the summer. You’ll need to pack plenty of sunscreen and SPF attire, but you’ll also be able to find slightly more affordable nightly rates at some of the destination’s best hotels. Given the higher temperatures, add in plenty of water-based activities to your itinerary. Guests at Montage Los Cabos, for instance, can enjoy a sportfishing excursion along the Baja Peninsula, snorkel in Santa Maria Bay, or explore the caves and reefs in the Sea of Cortez while scuba diving.</p>

<h6>Experience sauna culture in Helsinki.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>Finnish sauna culture isn’t just relegated to the dark, cold days of winter; it’s a year-round activity. You can experience the transformative effects of it firsthand in Helsinki, home to a number of public saunas. Along with its wood-fired saunas, Löyly has a lovely outdoor swimming pool and outdoor terrace. At Allas Pool, you can take a dip in the cold seawater in between sauna sessions. And you’ll need to hop on a quick ferry to get to Lonna’s seaside saunas and terrace.

<h6>See the world on a European river cruise.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>“While river cruises have long been popular with a more seasoned clientele, I’m seeing a new wave of younger travelers embracing them in a big way,” says Seasen Acevedo-Zullo, a Fora travel advisor specializing in Europe and cruises. “These travelers are drawn to the ease of unpacking once while experiencing multiple destinations, the culturally rich itineraries, and the intimate, well-curated onboard experience.” Some of the best European river cruise lines include Avalon Waterways and Scenic, which have fleets that take travelers down the Rhine, Danube, Main, and Moselle rivers.</p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Learn how to surf in Sumba, Indonesia.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>Typically, summer isn’t the best time to visit Southeast Asia. It’s hot, humid, and rainy. Indonesia, however, is the exception to the rule—but we’re not suggesting you go to Bali. Sumba, rather, is the place you should have on your radar. This time of year, the rural, wild destination experiences its dry season, bringing the best weather for surfing, hiking, and lounging on the island’s stunning beaches. For an extra luxurious stay, book a room at Nihi Sumba, a repeat World’s Best Award recipient.</p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Stay in an overwater bungalow in <a href="https://bb.usembassy.gov" target="_blank">Antigua</a>.</h6>    

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>There’s no need to journey all the way to the Maldives or Bora Bora to stay in an overwater bungalow. Instead, book a flight to V.C. Bird International Airport. From there, it’s a quick transfer to the Royalton Chic Antigua, an adults-only all-inclusive resort that recently debuted a dozen new overwater suites. Each of the accommodations comes with a private swim-out infinity plunge pool, an overwater hammock, and direct ocean access. </p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Head to the Arctic to see whales.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>It might be summer, but that doesn’t mean you have to fully embrace the warm weather. “Travelers are shifting their focus, moving away from the usual sun-drenched getaways and leaning into more unexpected experiences,” says Acevedo-Zullo, who has seen an uptick in travelers wanting to plan trips to the Arctic—namely, places like Greenland and Iceland. “The Arctic is having a moment … and it makes sense. These destinations offer dramatic landscapes, fewer crowds, and a true sense of adventure. People are looking for something that feels once-in-a-lifetime, and swapping tropical beaches for glaciers and fjords delivers exactly that.” Summer is also a great time for wildlife viewing in these places; in fact, it’s one of the best times for whale watching.</p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Journey to the remote Greek island of Folegandros.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>Summer 2025 is all about discovering lesser-known locations. So, instead of joining the crowds on Mykonos and Santorini, enjoy a Greek vacation on the Cycladic island of Folegandros. Consider a stay at Gundari, a luxury boutique hotel set on a cliffside with 30 bioclimatic villas, a solar-powered infinity pool, and unparalleled views of the Aegean Sea.</p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Traverse <a href="https://ch.usembassy.gov" target="_blank">Switzerland</a> by train.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>There are plenty of things Switzerland does well—and train travel is one of them. With a Swiss Travel Pass in hand, you can hop aboard most trains (as well as buses and boats) without a reservation. This gives you the freedom to explore big cities like Geneva and Zurich as well as smaller towns and villages like Wengen, Gstaad, and Lauterbrunnen. Fondue, mountain views, and the sound of cowbells await.</p>

<h6>Ski in <a href="https://ar.usembassy.gov" target="_blank">Argentina</a>.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>Not ready to let go of ski season? Chase the colder weather by flying down to Mendoza, Argentina, where you can hit the slopes at Las Leñas ski resort from mid-June to mid-October. If you’re interested in adding a stop in the region’s wine country, head north to Susana Balbo’s Winemaker’s House & Spa Suites. The wellness- and wine-focused property is the ideal spot to rest and relax after a few days of shredding; the spa suites even come with their own private dry saunas.</p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Venture north to Prince Edward Island.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>Prince Edward Island is widely known among those who count themselves fans of L.M. Montgomery's “Anne of Green Gables.” But even if you haven’t read about Anne Shirley’s adventures on PEI, which sits between the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, there’s a high probability you’ll still appreciate the atmosphere summer brings to the island. Expect beach weather, fresh lobster lunches, and long hikes along the coast.</p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Hit the beach in the Cayman Islands.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>There’s a time and a place for active travel, but sometimes all you need is a trip where you can alternate between reading on the beach and swimming in turquoise waters. If that sounds like your kind of vacation, plan for a few days in the Cayman Islands. “Grand Cayman still has that exclusive, tucked-away feel without being overrun by mass tourism, making it an ideal choice for those wanting an island escape with a refined yet adventurous edge,” says Acevedo-Zullo. “Travelers looking for a mix of adventure and relaxation will love the incredible snorkeling and diving opportunities, from the vibrant coral reefs at Eden Rock to the eerie beauty of the Kittiwake shipwreck.”</p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Join a gorilla trekking excursion in <a href="https://rw.usembassy.gov" target="_blank">Rwanda</a>.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>The months of June, July, and August—Rwanda’s dry season—are known to be some of the best times for gorilla trekking. To experience this once-in-a-lifetime adventure, reach out to conservation and hospitality company Wilderness. The team creates custom itineraries for travelers interested in seeing mountain gorillas, as well as other big game, in their natural habitats.</p>

<!-- PARAGRAPH HEADER -->
<h6>Embark on a hut-to-hut hike in the Dolomites.</h6>

<!-- PARAGRAPH TEXT -->
<p>If you’re an experienced hiker ready for your next challenge, the Dolomites may be calling your name. Summer is prime time for hiking amid the northern Italian Alps, and one of the most popular ways to explore the mountains is by trekking from hut to hut. You’ll spend your days ascending and descending the rocky terrain and then get some shut-eye in rugged but comfortable rifugios—just be sure to book your accommodations ASAP, as they tend to book up in advance.</p>
