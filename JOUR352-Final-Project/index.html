<p>When we compare long-term temperature data between two drastically different locations, we almost always do so using averages. But when I stepped out of my College Park apartment at around 8:50 a.m. on Feb. 18, I was met with a piercing mix of frigid air and howling wind — a brutal sensation that entirely changed my way of thinking.</p>

<p>As I muddled through my thoughts on my way to class that morning, I begrudgingly checked the forecasted high temperature in my hometown of Long Beach, California, for that Tuesday.</p> 

<p>In exact alignment with my expectations, the people of Long Beach were expecting clear skies and 70-degree weather that day. The temperature in Maryland that morning was below freezing.</p> 

<p>The comical difference in conditions caused me to ditch the traditional practice of using averages, as I asked myself, “How many total degrees am I missing out on by living in College Park?”</p>

<p>It’s fair to say that I took the beautiful Southern California climate for granted during my 18 years growing up there.</p> 

<p>Limited humidity, consistent day-to-day temperatures, and 60-degree highs during the winter are seldom found anywhere else in the country, which I knew when I started looking at out-of-state colleges and universities. Though I didn’t truly understand this fact until I experienced an East Coast winter.</p>

<p>As a freshman in 2024, I frequently checked my phone’s weather app on Maryland’s cold and windy winter days. I was ironically being cruel to myself through this practice, and yet, my old habit returned early in the 2025 spring semester.</p> 

<p>I eventually realized that staring at the weather app wasn’t going to change Maryland’s winter conditions, so I instead turned my time-wasting tendency into productivity.</p> 

<p>The data that’s laid out below serves to answer the aforementioned question of, “How many total degrees am I missing out on by living in College Park?” And admittedly, the study does so in laughably tedious fashion.</p>

<p>I haven’t exclusively been in College Park for the entire school year. I returned to College Park for my sophomore year in late August, and during the fall semester, I spent part of Thanksgiving break in Princeton, New Jersey.</p> 

<p>I then returned home between semesters (mid-December and late January).</p>

<p>During the spring semester, I took a day trip to State College, Pennsylvania (in late January), and spent a portion of the mid-March spring break in Fort Lauderdale.</p> 

<p>I’ve done my best to document that travel in the map video to the right (or below, for those viewing on a mobile device).</p>

<p>I’ve made sure to factor all of my time away from College Park into the data below, leaving me with 192 total days at UMD since starting my sophomore year.</p>

<h6>Data Disclaimers:</h6>
<ul>
	<li>The vast majority of the data was taken from timeanddate.com (<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/usa/long-beach/historic" target="_blank">Long Beach</a> & <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/@4351977/historic" target="_blank">College Park</a>), with supplemental figures from <a href="https://www.accuweather.com" target="_blank">AccuWeather.com</a> as well.</li>
	<li>The temperature logged each day for the two locations was the <strong>daytime</strong> high temperature. I didn't think it necessary to log a high temperature if it occurred at night, since I'm predominantly outside during the daytime.</li>
	<li>Travel days (i.e., a day that I flew from Long Beach to College Park) are omitted from the data. Since I'm moving between locations these days, I don't think it's fair to say that I may have been "missing out" on degrees.</li>
</ul>	


<h6>Data Analysis</h6>

<p>Over the 192 days that I’ve spent at UMD this school year, College Park has amassed <strong>12,643 degrees</strong> in daytime high temperatures, while Long Beach has accumulated <strong>13,767 degrees</strong>.</p>

<p>In overly simplified terms, that means I’ve missed out on about <strong>1,124 degrees</strong> by being in College Park, when I (theoretically) could’ve been in Long Beach (had I decided not to go to college).</p> 

<p>This difference is actually a little bit lower than I originally expected, and I think that’s because I overlooked some of Maryland’s brutally hot days in the late summer/early fall, when I initially had this idea in mid-February.</p>

<p><strong>August:</strong> A small sample size of just six days, but the average daytime high temperature during that span was 88 degrees. That average figure sat at 80.5 degrees in Long Beach over that same span.</p>

<p><strong>September:</strong> Peak yearly heat in Long Beach tends to be later in the summer, and it often spills into September as well. That was certainly the case this year, as Long Beach saw a hotter September than College Park due to a significant heat wave early in the month. Long Beach temperatures reportedly reached 109 degrees on Sept. 6th, the hottest figure recorded amongst either location during this study.</p>

<p><strong>October:</strong> The overall temperature split between the two locations was as expected in October. Summer warmth often carries into October as well in Long Beach, and the city saw 12 80-plus-degree days as a result; Maryland saw just six during October.</p>

<p><strong>November:</strong> This is understandably where we start to see significant separation. Long Beach was nearly 200 degrees hotter than Maryland during November, as the latter started seeing a fair number of days below 60, toward the end of the month.</p>

<p><strong>December & January:</strong> I grouped these two months together because I only had a combined 16 days worth of data. Late January never saw a greater daily difference in the double figures, although several days in early December saw Long Beach carry a daily high that was 20-plus degrees hotter.</p>

<p><strong>February:</strong> This was the month that ultimately inspired the project, and for good reason. Long Beach was 533 degrees warmer than College Park — the most significant difference in a month, by a sizable margin. Feb. 19 was a specifically notable day, as the College Park high was just 27 degrees (the only time it was below 30), and there was a massive 43-degree difference between the two locations that day.</p>

<p><strong>March:</strong> In what was a fairly cool month for both places, Long Beach remained the slightly warmer of the two. Nevertheless, College Park closed the sizable gap from the previous month down to just 46 degrees — somewhat due in part to a DMV heatwave at the end of the month.</p>

<p><strong>April:</strong> College Park saw a mix of hot and cold during April, with a decisive split near the middle of the month. 12 of the first 17 days saw daytime highs in the 60s or lower, yet there wasn’t a single daytime high below 70 degrees from that point on.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s difficult to draw concrete conclusions about what the data means in its totality, since I only have the lone school year as a reference point.</p>

<p>If I were to take the project further, I’d probably compare the numbers to figures from my freshman year at UMD. Last year felt slightly warmer (generally speaking), so I’d be interested to see if the numbers would back that up. Additionally, I’d also have some interest in comparing College Park’s totals to some of the other places I considered going to college.</p>

<p>Hypotheticals aside, though, this exploration certainly highlighted my recency bias, as I didn’t consider the volatility of Maryland’s weather when I first had this idea during the winter.</p>

	<blockquote>
<p2>“Within every season, you will get all four seasons.”  <br> - Gibson Hirt, sophomore at UMD (from Bethesda, MD).</p2>
    </blockquote>
</aside>

<p>Being away from home also allows me the opportunity to see the world through a different lens, which is one of the many reasons why I chose UMD over some of the options that were closer to home.</p>

<aside class="pull-quote-two">
	<blockquote>
<p2>“In fairness, it's been interesting to get a firsthand look at all four seasons.” <br> - Ben Geffner, sophomore at UMD (from Encino, CA).</p2>
    </blockquote>
</aside>

<p>I certainly lose sight of that sometimes, as evidenced by the fact that I went through with this entire project.</p>

<p>Even though I’ve missed out on over 1,200 degrees of warmth this school year, I’ve gained a wealth of knowledge and experience that’s specific to UMD. I should keep that in mind the next time I complain about the weather.</p>
